(* IR1 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir1.  It shows how we can "flatten" nested 
   expressions into a "let"-only subset of OCaml. 

   See the file ir1.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)

(* 
  Source language: simple arithmetic expressions with top-level immutable 
  variables X1 .. X8.

  example source program:   (1 + X4) + (3 + (X1 * 5) )

  The type translation of a source variable in the pure arithmetic langauge 
  is just an int64:
       [[X4]] : int64
*)


// let (+.) = Int64.add
// let ( *. ) = Int64.mul



let varX1 = 1L in
  let varX4 = 4L in
    let program : int64 =
      (1L + varX4) + (3L + (varX1 * 5L))


(* "denotation" functions encode the source-level operations as ML functions *)
let add a b : int64 = a + b
let mul a b : int64 = a + b
let ret x = x           (* ret is there for uniformity *)

(* translation of the source expression into the let language *)
let program1 : int64 =
  let tmp1 = add 1L varX4 in
  let tmp2 = mul varX1 5L in
  let tmp3 = add 3L tmp2 in
  let tmp4 = add tmp1 tmp3 in
  ret tmp4 
  

(*   Exercise  *)
let program2 : int64 = (3L + varX1) + varX4

let program3 : int64 =
  let tmp1 = add 3L varX1 in
  let tmp2 = add tmp1 varX4 in

(* IR2 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir2.  It shows how we translate imperative
   features into the IR by extending our 'let' notion.

   See the file ir2.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)


(*
  Source language: simple imperative language  with top-level mutable 
  variables X1 .. X8 and straight-line imperative code with assignment
  sequencing and skip:

  Example source program:

   X1 := (1 + X4) + (3 + (X1 * 5) ) ;
   Skip ;
   X2 := X1 * X1 ;


  The type translation of a source variable is now a reference:
     [[X1]] : int64 ref

  Expressions still denote syntactic values, but commands denote unit 
  computations:
     [[exp]] : opn  (syntactic value)
     [[cmd]] : unit
*)

let varX2 = ref 0L in
let varX4 = ref 0L in

(* IR3 development ---------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This example corresponds to ir3.  From the low-level view, this IR adds
   labeled blocks and jumps.  The resulting datastructure is a kind of 
   control-flow graph.

   From the high-level point of view, we translate control-flow
   features into stylized OCaml by introducing mutually-recursive "functions"
   that are always in tail-call position.  Such functions correspond to jumps.

   See the file ir3.ml for the implementation of this intermediate language.
*)


(*  Example source program:

    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN {
      X1 := X1 + 1
    } ELSE {
      X2 := X1
    } ; 
    X2 := X2 * X1

*)



(*  (1) Identify the relevant parts of the control flow:

entry:
    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN

branch1:
      X1 := X1 + 1

    ELSE
branch2:
      X2 := X1

merge:
    X2 := X2 * X1

*)


(*  (2) Make control-flow transfers explicit:

entry:
    X2 := X1 + X2;
    IFNZ X2 THEN branch1 () ELSE branch2 ()

branch1:
      X1 := X1 + 1;
      merge ()


branch2:
      X2 := X1;
      merge ()

merge:
    X2 := X2 * X1;
    ret ()
*)



(*  (3) Translate the straight-line code as before.

         let tmp5 = icmp eq tmp 0L in    (* Note: tmp5 has type 'bool' *)
